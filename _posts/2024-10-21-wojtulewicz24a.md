title: 'On Speeding Up the Training of Deep Neural Networks Using the Streaming Approach:
  The Base-Values Mechanism'
abstract: Efficient and stable neural network training is crucial for advancing machine
  learning applications. This study explores the promising streaming approach as an
  alternative to traditional epoch-based methods. This paradigm shift involves transforming
  training data into a continuous stream, prioritizing challenging examples to enhance
  the learning process. Building upon this approach, we introduce an innovative Base-Values
  mechanism aimed at further improving the speed and stability of the streaming training
  process. We apply this framework to the original streaming training algorithms,
  resulting in algorithms such as Persistent Loss-Based (PLB) and Persistent Entropy-Based
  algorithm (PEB). We conduct a comprehensive experimental comparison on EMNIST dataset,
  analyzing traditional epoch-based methods and the streaming approach, including
  both original and new methods employing the Base-Values mechanism. The exploration
  of various hyperparameters, including pre-training length, mini-batch size, and
  learning rate, provides valuable insights into their impact on the performance and
  stability of those neural network training methods. The results demonstrate the
  superior performance of a novel streaming algorithm that incorporates the Base-Values
  mechanism compared to both a traditional epoch-based method and other methods.
