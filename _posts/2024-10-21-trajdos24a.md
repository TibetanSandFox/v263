title: A dual ensemble classifier used to recognise contaminated multi-channel EMG
  and MMG signals in the control of upper limb bioprosthesis
abstract: Myopotential pattern recognition to decode the intent of the user is the
  most advanced approach to controlling a powered bioprosthesis. Unfortunately, many
  factors make this a difficult problem and achieving acceptable recognition quality
  in real-word conditions is a serious challenge. The aim of the paper is to develop
  a recognition system that will mitigate factors related to multimodality and multichannel
  recording of biosignals and their high susceptibility to contamination. The proposed
  method involves the use of two co-operating multiclassifier systems. The first system
  is composed of one-class classifiers related to individual electromyographic (EMG)
  and mechanomyographic (MMG) biosignal recording channels, and its task is to recognise
  contaminated channels. The role of the second system is to recognise the class of
  movement resulting from the patientâ€™s intention. The ensemble system consists of
  base classifiers using the representation (extracted features) of biosignals from
  different channels. The system uses a dynamic selection mechanism, eliminating those
  base classifiers that are associated with biosignal channels that are recognised
  by the one-class ensemble system as being contaminated. Experimental studies were
  conducted using signals from an able-bodied person with simulation of amputation.
  The results obtained confirm the hypothesis that the use of a dual ensemble classifier
  leads to improved classification quality.
