title: Silhouette Distance Loss for Learning Few-Shot Contrastive Representations
abstract: Conventional supervised contrastive learning methods excel in optimising
  encoders for discriminative tasks. In scenarios where only a few labelled samples
  are available, however, they struggle in eliminating the inductive bias when transferring
  from source to target classes. This is a byproduct (and inherent limitation) of
  their underlying optimisation process that involves training a representation to
  maximise class separation, without directly optimising for within-class cohesion.
  As a response to this limitation this paper introduces the Silhouette Distance (SD)
  loss, a new optimisation objective for supervised contrastive representation learning.
  SD aims to enhance the quality of learned embeddings by emphasising both the cohesion
  and separation of representation clusters for each class. We test SD extensively
  across several few-shot learning scenarios—where labelled data is limited—and we
  compare its performance against supervised contrastive loss and prototypical network
  loss for various text and image classification tasks. We also test SD in a cross-domain
  manner, by training a model on one dataset and testing it on another, within the
  same modality. Our results demonstrate the superior, at worst competitive, performance
  of the SD loss compared to its baselines. By leveraging pre-trained models and fine-tuning
  techniques, our study highlights how the SD loss can effectively improve representation
  learning across different modalities and domains. This initial study showcases the
  potential of the SD loss as a robust alternative within the few-shot learning setting.
