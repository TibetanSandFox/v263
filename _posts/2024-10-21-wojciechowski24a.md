title: "$F_Β$-plot - a visual tool for evaluationg imabalnced data classifiers"
abstract: Imbalanced data classification suffers from a lack of reliable metrics.
  This runs primarily from the fact that for most real-life (and commonly used benchmark)
  problems, we do not have information from the user on the actual form of the loss
  function that should be minimized. Although it is pretty common to have metrics
  indicating the classification quality within each class, for the end user, the analysis
  of several such metrics is then required, which in practice causes difficulty in
  interpreting the usefulness of a given classifier. Hence, many aggregate metrics
  have been proposed or adopted for the imbalanced data classification problem, but
  there is still no consensus on which should be used. An additional disadvantage
  is their ambiguity and systematic bias toward one class. Moreover, their use in
  analyzing experimental results in recognition of those classification models that
  perform well for the chosen aggregated metrics is burdened with the abovementioned
  drawbacks. Hence, the paper proposes a simple approach to analyzing the popular
  parametric metric Fᵦ. We point out that it is possible to indicate for a given pool
  of analyzed classifiers when a given model should be preferred depending on user
  requirements.
