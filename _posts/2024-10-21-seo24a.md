title: Keypoint Mask-based Local Feature Matching and Keypoint Erasing-based Global
  Feature Representations for Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification
abstract: In Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification, the most crucial challenge
  is reducing the Modality discrepancy between visible and infrared images. To address
  this, various approaches such as data augmentation, generative transformation for
  the opposite modality, and extraction of Modality-Shared and Modality-Specific features
  have been attempted. While each approach has contributed significantly to performance
  improvement, re-identification remains particularly challenging when dealing with
  individuals who have similar clothing or body shapes but are different persons.
  It is mainly due to the inconsistency in representing identical local features across
  cross-modalities in existing methods. This paper proposes a novel learning representations
  of keypoint-based local and global features. Keypoint-based masking for local feature
  representation learning aims to normalize the representations of each keypointâ€™s
  locality, thereby reducing the modality gap at the feature level. Representation
  learning for local features using keypoint-based masking reduces feature-level modality
  gaps by identifying the local representation of each keypoint. Representation learning
  for global features using keypoint-based eraing increases the efficiency and diversity
  of the global representation by generating images that cover the same area. We compare
  our proposed methodology and various existing methods for the mAP and Rank-1 performances
  on the SYSU-MM01 datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model
  effectively solves the existing key and critical problems.
